# Expose download capability

Download functionality is restored from github version. Need to hook this into some kind of action from frontend.
* Book Page
* Search Results?

Need multithreading, separating the download from the queue
    * Some way to hook in for status would be nice

# Future enhancements

View downloaded comics from frontend
Include metadata as a record for downloaded comics
